# Green Coding with Spring Boot: Sustainability as a Path to Better Software

Green coding is more than just a trend – it is a promise of quality.

Those who focus on resource‑efficient software naturally make better choices: more efficient code, more stable systems, and lower operating costs. This session shows how to achieve that with Spring Boot.

We focus on architectural principles and performance optimisations that save energy – while also making the codebase leaner, more maintainable, and more scalable. This includes choosing the right data structures and algorithms, purposeful use of Spring Boot components, and optimising servers and cloud infrastructures.

For everyone who wants to develop not only in a "green" way – but above all in a better way.
